                Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
              </h2>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) built to model sequential data. Since earthquakes follow complex time-based patterns, LSTM is well-suited for analyzing how past seismic events shape future ones.

              </p>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                In our system, we use a pure LSTM model to forecast the maximum annual earthquake magnitude per region. This focuses on identifying the strongest possible seismic events, helping provide a clearer picture of potential hazards each year.

                Attention - LSTM
              </h2>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                While LSTM captures time-based dependencies, it does not always distinguish which past events matter most. To address this, we integrate an Attention Mechanism—a technique that allows the model to prioritize significant seismic signals while minimizing less relevant ones.
              </p>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                This enhanced Attention-LSTM model is applied to forecast annual earthquake frequency. By highlighting critical patterns in earthquake history, the attention mechanism strengthens the model’s ability to recognize recurring seismic activity and improves forecasting accuracy compared to standard LSTM

                Spatio-temporal Forecasting Concept
              </h2>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                Spatio-temporal forecasting means looking at earthquakes in both
                time (when they happen) and space (where they happen). By
                combining these two factors, we can see trends in how
                earthquakes affect different regions over the years.
              </p>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                This approach uses modern tools to give a clearer picture of
                which areas are at higher risk in the future. The goal is to
                provide easy-to-understand forecasts that help people,
                communities, and decision-makers stay safer and more prepared.

                Quadtree Spatial Binning
              </h2>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                Earthquake activity in the Philippines is uneven—some regions experience frequent seismic events, while others remain relatively quiet. To capture this, we applied Quadtree-based Spatial Binning, an adaptive method that divides the country into smaller regions or “bins” depending on earthquake density.
              </p>
              <p className="about-page-section-paragraph">
                Active zones are represented with finer bins, while low-activity areas are grouped into larger bins. After merging, these bins form static spatial zones used by the models. In simple terms, bins act as statistical containers that balance earthquake distribution across regions, making forecasts more reliable and region-specific.

                  We are 4th-year Computer Science students from Holy Angel
                  University conducting a research study entitled
                  “Spatiotemporal Earthquake Forecasting in the Philippines
                  Modelling Attention LSTM ” Our study aims to develop a
                  forecasting system that analyzes historical earthquake data
                  from PHIVOLCS to generate annual predictions of earthquake
                  frequency and maximum magnitude per region. The system
                  integrates an Attention-Driven Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
                  model with a Quadtree-based spatial binning algorithm and
                  provides results through an interactive visualization
                  platform.
